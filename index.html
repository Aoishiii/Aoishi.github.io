									<h2><a href="#"> Personal Information<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>Hi my name is Aaron Moyle, I'm 22 Born in Australia, My Student ID is S3939948, I'm currently Studying at RMIT University
the last Forum of education i had was a Diploma of Interactive Media and Game Design in 2018 before working for my brother in law for his Company Wafflesoft where we started the design on the project "Outback Survival" before i moved my intrests away from game design
and closer towards AI design, though i wouldn't be able to communicate with other AI scientists around the world as i can only speak one language Fluently despite going around the world And would probably need an Interpreter aha.

									<p>.Strength:– Protagonists have strong opinions, but they’re far from closed-minded This makes the Protagonist very Reliable when it comes to getting projects done or wishes seen through,
                                                                        Protaganists are very passionate about the work they do and the effort they put in, They're far from being a boiring do-gooder, these types of people take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies -
									whether thats hiking, cooking, programming, horticulture or someone elses task. as a result they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do, Protaganists are Very charismatic, often finding away
									to brighten up peoples spirits and take on a leadership role whether captian of a soccer team or leader on the world stage they rarely lose sight of their main goal.
										Weaknesses:- Many protagonists put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter no matter how small or unrealisitc the problem is thats causing them to put this preassure on themselves
                                                                         sometime this preassure can be caused by Overly Idealistic goals which at times can cause conflict when their fundamental principles feel  violated Sometimes protagonists can be Intense to be around, trying to push others
                                                                        to make changes that they might not be ready for, Protagonists are also Overly empathetic meaning that they have a tendency to take on other people's problems as their own.</p>
